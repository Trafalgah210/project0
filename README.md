for the design of the website i used a bootstrap that i downloaded on https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/. This theme features a blog homepage, about page
the design is the core skeleton of my project 
i created 4 files that are linked to each other
the files are 4 html links and css style for the website, boostrap css and javascript
the files that are not html are in the "assets" folder same as the images that were used for the project
in the file index we have the home pas of the website with the plot of the manga, the home and all the other pages have an image integretated in the header
we have a navigation bar to allow the user to navigate between the website
